# Square Root Programming Challenge

This is the programming challenge that I often gave to interns on my R&D team as a first introduction to system calls.

Challenge is to create a program in C that runs in Linux that calculates the square root of a floating point number, formats the output properly, then prints it to the console.  

Can't use ANY libraries (no printf, no sqrt function, etc.)
